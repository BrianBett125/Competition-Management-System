      <h3>Easy Online Registration</h3>
      <p>This feature allows potential participants to register
         for the competition online easily. It eliminates the need for paper forms
          and streamlines the application process. Users can fill out information, upload required
           documents, and pay fees (if applicable) all in one place.</p>

      <h3>Streamlined Application Management</h3>
      <p>This feature helps competition organizers manage applications efficiently. They can view a list of all applicants, review
         individual profiles, download submitted documents, and easily
          communicate with participants through the system.</p>

      <p>Secure Judging and Evaluation</p>
      <p>This advanced feature allows organizers to set up secure judging processes. Judges can access
         and evaluate submissions anonymously, assign scores based on pre-defined criteria, and provide feedback 
         electronically. This ensures a fair and transparent judging process.</p>

    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      
I recently participated in a Hackathon competition, and the experience was amazing!
 But managing registrations, deadlines, and communication for everyone
  involved became a huge hassle. It took me and my team five weeks to 
  build this competition management system to streamline the entire process for future events.
   This is a Portfolio Project for Holberton School: https://www.holbertonschool.com/
